## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- BANA business card guidance is now reproduced verbatim from the *Business Cards Fact Sheet* (approved March 2024) in `docs/guides/BUSINESS_CARD_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md`, the Directions dropdown in `templates/index.html`, and the "What to Include", "Formatting", and "Examples" help panels in `public/index.html`.
- The Business Card Guide now shows BANA's published Grade 2 braille (in Unicode U+2800–U+28FF) alongside the app-specific Grade 1 "what to type" hint for each of BANA's nine worked examples, so users can see the source cells directly without needing to open the PDF.
- The in-app Examples panel in `public/index.html` likewise shows the BANA Grade 2 braille verbatim for each of its three example cards, with an `aria-label` describing each rendering for screen readers.
- README pointer to the Business Card Guide now cites the BANA source year (March 2024).

### Added
- `docs/guides/_bana_business_cards_verified_source.md` — verified visual transcription of the BANA Fact Sheet with verbatim prose, Unicode-braille (U+2800–U+28FF) renderings of all nine worked examples, and a deviation report driving the rewrite above.
- `scripts/fetch_bana_business_cards.py` — one-shot script that downloads the BANA PDF and rasterizes each page to `docs/guides/_bana_source/page_NN.png` for future verification.
- `scripts/_extract_bana_text.py` — working tool that pairs each NABA-ASCII-encoded line in the PDF with its Unicode-braille equivalent.

### Fixed
- Removed prior paraphrased BANA rule statements that drifted from the source. The drift was caused by previous rewrites being derived from the PDF's hidden NABA-ASCII text layer (which renders as `,h>ry ,pott]` to any PDF-to-text tool) instead of the visual layer. Specific corrections:
  - Phone-number "Best/OK/Poor" table replaced by BANA's single prescriptive statement.
  - E-mail and web-address division priorities replaced by BANA's three-tier statement, including the dot-5 continuation indicator and its "as a last resort, omit" fallback that was previously absent.
  - "Common abbreviations" list trimmed to the three BANA names by example (`lib`, `amer`, `nat`); previously-invented entries (`Assoc`, `Univ`) removed.
  - Removed the claim that we adapt BANA's worked examples to Grade 1 — we now keep our Grade 1 input hints but make explicit that BANA's published examples are Grade 2.
- Second-pass audit of the Directions dropdown in `templates/index.html` against the BANA PDF page images caught additional drift, all now corrected:
  - "Common fixes if text won't fit (BANA order)" was a single numbered list that conflated BANA's name fall-through (4 items, of which the last is BANA's parallel "if space is available" option, not a final fallback), BANA's organization-name strategies (presented in BANA as parallel options), and the app's own Grade 2 recommendation (not part of BANA's order at all). The list is now split into three clearly labeled sections.
  - The abridged Phone, E‑mail, and Web quotes have been replaced with the full verbatim paragraphs from page 3 of the Fact Sheet. The previous "E‑mail / web" combined bullet only quoted the e‑mail punctuation list ("at" sign, period, hyphen) and silently dropped the web-address punctuation list (colon, period, slash).
  - Restored BANA's "13 or 14 cells, depending on the equipment" cell-count caveat where the friendly intro had simplified to "about 13".
  - Lowercased the "amer" abbreviation example to match BANA's own spelling.
- `public/index.html` worked-example braille (`<pre>` blocks for BANA Examples 1, 4, and 7) now uses U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK between words, matching the BANA PDF and the verified-source markdown, so the "verbatim from the Fact Sheet" label is honest at the codepoint level.
- `docs/guides/_bana_business_cards_verified_source.md` Example 6 heading had inadvertently duplicated Example 5's title ("Omission of capitals from name; division of surname; omission of company name (in e-mail)"). Replaced with BANA's actual Example 6 heading ("Division of hyphenated name (client agreed to a shortened first name); omission of capitals from post-nominal letters/credentials; omission of organization name (in e-mail)").
- Resynced the second "BANA-quoted blocks below — DO NOT EDIT" comment block in `public/index.html` (above the Formatting Rules panel) to match the propagation reminder in the first block, so future edits don't drift between the two panels.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-16

Documentation overhaul. Rewrote all project docs to remove AI-generated language and match the tone of a small, single-maintainer open-source project.

### Changed
- Rewrote README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, PROJECT_STRUCTURE, and RELEASING
- Rewrote all docs in docs/security/, docs/deployment/, and docs/development/
- Trimmed ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md, and the specifications index
- Cleaned up "comprehensive", "robust", and other AI patterns across specification files
- Cut MAJOR_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SOP from 1000+ lines to a practical 70-line checklist
- Updated bug report template and GitHub repository metadata

### Removed
- docs/development/IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS_ANALYSIS.md (530-line AI self-review with no value for contributors)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-06

Major architecture change: removed all external service dependencies. The server is now a minimal Flask app that serves geometry specs — all STL generation happens in the browser.

### Why v2.0.0

- Removed Upstash Redis (free tier archives after 14 days of inactivity, breaking the app)
- Removed Vercel Blob storage (no longer needed)
- Moved all STL generation to client-side Web Workers
- Server now only needs Flask and Flask-CORS

### Added
- Python 3.13 support
- Health check loop in CI for stable Lighthouse audits
- Updated all GitHub Actions, npm, and pip packages to latest stable versions

### Changed
- Default braille dot shape is now cone (better print quality and tactile feel)
- Server only provides geometry specs; all CSG operations run client-side
- GitHub Actions updated to checkout@v6, setup-python@v6, setup-node@v6
- three-mesh-bvh updated to 0.9.4

### Removed
- Upstash Redis dependency
- Vercel Blob storage dependency
- Server-side STL generation
- Flask-Limiter (Vercel handles DDoS protection)
- requests library (was only used for blob upload)

### Fixed
- CI pipeline PORT variable for Flask server
- Replaced fixed sleep with health check loop in CI

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-09

- Issue and PR templates
- Dependabot for pip and npm
- SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- lighthouserc.json, package.json, .vercelignore

### Fixed
- Various CI configuration issues (manifold3d deps, FLASK_ENV, ruff version sync, requirements filename, html5validator version)
- Reduced Vercel serverless function size under 250 MB limit

### Removed
- AI tool-specific plan files

---

- Dead code cleanup (~680 lines removed)
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance verified

---

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-27

First stable release.

### Features
- Braille text translation via liblouis (Grade 1 and Grade 2, 50+ language tables)
- Flat business card plates and cylindrical objects
- Real-time 3D preview with Three.js
- Client-side STL generation with three-bvh-csg and Manifold WASM

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Repository renamed to `braille-cylinder-stl-generator`.** The UI has
  generated cylinders only since v2.0.0, so "card-and-cylinder" no longer
  described the tool. GitHub redirects the old URLs, and the deployed Vercel
  URL is unchanged — existing links and QR codes keep working. `package.json`,
  the README title, badges, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, the in-app GitHub links,
  and the workspace file all follow the new name.
- **Flat business card plates are documented as parked, not "temporarily
  disabled".** They will not return in this repo; see
  [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md). Directly readable braille cards
  already ship as
  [braille-wedge-card-openscad](https://github.com/BrennenJohnston/braille-wedge-card-openscad).

### Planned
- Additional language support
- Custom dot shape options
- Batch processing
- OpenSCAD export option
