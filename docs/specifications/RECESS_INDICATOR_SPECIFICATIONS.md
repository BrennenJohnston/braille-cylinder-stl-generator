# Recess Indicator Specifications

## Overview

This document provides **strict specifications** for the recessed indicators used in the braille card and cylinder STL generator, plus the tactile seam indicator that replaces them on cylinders.

The three **visual** indicator types (triangle, rectangle, character) are always **subtracted** (recessed) into both positive (embossing) and negative (counter) plates. They must maintain precise orientation and positioning across all generation methods:
- Python backend (`backend.py`)
- Standard CSG Worker (`csg-worker.js` using three-bvh-csg)
- Manifold CSG Worker (`csg-worker-manifold.js` using Manifold WASM)

### Row Indicator Style (`indicator_mode`)

Cylinders offer two mutually exclusive styles, selected by the user-facing **"Row Indicator Style"** control (runtime field `indicator_mode`, `visual` | `tactile`, default `visual`). Cylinder diameter, height, and cutout are identical either way, so **both plates of a pair must use the same style**.

| | `visual` (default) | `tactile` |
|---|---|---|
| Where | Marker cells at the start of every row | One indicator per row, centred in the seam gap at 180° |
| Emboss plate | Recessed triangle (+ square when `indicator_shapes` is on) | **Raised** arrow, apex toward the cylinder top |
| Counter plate | Mirrored recesses | Matching arrow **recess** the arrow nests into |
| Cells used for markers | 2 (on) or 1 (off) | **0** |
| `indicator_shapes` | Gates the square | Ignored |

Tactile mode exists so a blind user can align the two cylinders unaided: the arrow is one continuous wedge, nothing like a braille dot, and its point tells them which end is up on either plate, while raised-versus-recessed tells them which cylinder they are holding. See [§4 Tactile Seam Indicator](#4-tactile-seam-indicator-cylinders-only) for the geometry.

`indicator_mode` is cylinder-only; cards ignore it and the UI hides the control when the shape is a card.

### Indicator Letters Toggle (`indicator_shapes`)

The user-facing **"Indicator Letters (Emboss and Counter)"** toggle (runtime field
`indicator_shapes`, 0 or 1, default 1) gates ONLY:
- the **character (letter) indicator** on the emboss plate (column 1 on cylinders,
  column 0 on cards), and
- the matching **rectangle (square) placeholder** on the counter plate.

The **triangle alignment indicators are ALWAYS generated** regardless of the toggle.
They are critical to the mechanical device the part mounts into and have no
user-facing option to disable.

In `visual` mode only. Tactile mode has no marker columns at all, so the toggle is ignored.

Reserved marker columns per row:
| Mode / Toggle | Reserved columns | Text cells at defaults |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| `visual`, toggle On (1) | 2 (letter + triangle) | 13 (15 total, 5.6 mm seam gap) |
| `visual`, toggle Off (0) | 1 (triangle only) | 13 (14 total, 12.1 mm seam gap) |
| `tactile` | 0 | 14 recommended (14 total, 12.1 mm seam gap; 15 leaves 5.6 mm, too little for the arrow) |

Visual mode recommends 13 text cells whichever way the toggle is set, because that is what a phone number takes on one row: a period-formatted number translates to exactly 13 cells under UEB (`206.616.7678` → `⠼⠃⠚⠋⠲⠋⠁⠋⠲⠛⠋⠛⠓`, one number sign), and a hyphenated one comes to 13 once the repeated number signs are edited out in the Braille (Unicode) field (`⠼⠑⠁⠚⠤⠃⠃⠊⠤⠛⠊⠁⠓`).

The single source for this arithmetic is `_reserved_marker_columns(settings, tactile_on)` in `app/geometry_spec.py`, mirrored by `getReservedMarkerColumns()` in `public/index.html` and the `reserved` calculation in `validate_line_lengths()`.

## Coordinate Systems

### Critical Understanding
Different parts of the system use different coordinate systems. **Coordinate mismatches are the primary cause of orientation bugs.**

| Component | Coordinate System | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Python Backend (trimesh) | Z-up | X = width, Y = height, Z = thickness |
| Three.js (csg-worker.js) | Y-up | X = width, Y = height (up), Z = depth |
| Manifold WASM | Z-up | Same as Python, no conversion needed |
| STL File Format | Z-up | Standard CAD convention |

### Conversion Rules

**Three.js (Y-up) to STL (Z-up):**
- For cylinders in `csg-worker.js`: Apply `geometry.rotateX(Math.PI / 2)` at the end
- For cards: No rotation needed (XY plane operations are consistent)

**Manifold (Z-up) to STL (Z-up):**
- No rotation needed - native compatibility

## 1. Triangle Marker Indicator

### Purpose
Indicates the END of each braille row (on cards) or serves as the START marker (on cylinders).

### Geometry Specification

```
Shape: Isoceles triangle with VERTICAL base on the LEFT, apex pointing RIGHT

Dimensions (relative to settings.dot_spacing):
- Base Height: 2 × dot_spacing (spans from top to bottom of braille cell)
- Triangle Width: 1 × dot_spacing (horizontal extension to apex)
- Recess Depth: 0.6mm (default)

Vertex Positions (given cell center at x, y):
- Bottom-left vertex: (x - dot_spacing/2, y - dot_spacing)
- Top-left vertex:    (x - dot_spacing/2, y + dot_spacing)
- Apex (right):       (x + dot_spacing/2, y)

Example for dot_spacing = 2.5mm at cell center (10, 20):
- Bottom-left: (8.75, 17.5)
- Top-left:    (8.75, 22.5)
- Apex:        (11.25, 20)
```

### Visual Representation
```
     ▲ y+
     │
  T ─┼─     T = Top-left vertex
  │ \│      B = Bottom-left vertex
  │  ►─ x+  A = Apex vertex
  │ /
  B ─       Arrow points RIGHT (positive X direction)
```

### Position on Cards (Flat Plates)

| Plate Type | Column Position | Cell X Calculation |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Positive/Embossing | Last column (grid_columns - 1) | `left_margin + (grid_columns-1) × cell_spacing + braille_x_adjust` |
| Counter/Negative | Last column (grid_columns - 1) | Same as positive |

### Position on Cylinders

| Plate Type | Column Position | Angular Position | Special Handling |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Positive/Embossing | Column 0 (first) | `apply_seam(start_angle)` = `-start_angle` | Normal orientation |
| Counter/Negative | Column 0 (first) | `apply_seam_mirrored(start_angle)` = `+start_angle` | **rotate_180 = true** |

### Counter Plate Triangle Rotation (CRITICAL)

For counter plates, the triangle must be rotated 180° from its center point to properly align with the embossing plate when paper is pressed between them:

```javascript
// In csg-worker.js and csg-worker-manifold.js
if (rotate_180) {
    // Original vertices: (-size/2, -size), (-size/2, +size), (+size/2, 0)
    // After 180° rotation: (+size/2, +size), (+size/2, -size), (-size/2, 0)
    triangleShape.moveTo(validSize / 2, validSize);    // Rotated bottom-left → top-right
    triangleShape.lineTo(validSize / 2, -validSize);   // Rotated top-left → bottom-right
    triangleShape.lineTo(-validSize / 2, 0);           // Apex now on LEFT
}
```

## 2. Rectangle Marker Indicator

### Purpose
Fallback indicator for rows where the first character is NOT alphanumeric (symbol, punctuation, or empty). Also used as placeholder on counter plate cylinders.

### Geometry Specification

```
Shape: Vertical rectangle (taller than wide)

Dimensions (relative to settings.dot_spacing):
- Width: 1 × dot_spacing
- Height: 2 × dot_spacing (matches braille cell height)
- Recess Depth: 0.5mm (default)

Center Position (given cell center at x, y):
- Rectangle centered at: (x + dot_spacing/2, y)
- This places it at the RIGHT column of the braille cell

Corner Vertices (given cell center x, y):
- Bottom-left:  (x, y - dot_spacing)
- Bottom-right: (x + dot_spacing, y - dot_spacing)
- Top-right:    (x + dot_spacing, y + dot_spacing)
- Top-left:     (x, y + dot_spacing)

Example for dot_spacing = 2.5mm at cell center (10, 20):
- Bottom-left:  (10, 17.5)
- Bottom-right: (12.5, 17.5)
- Top-right:    (12.5, 22.5)
- Top-left:     (10, 22.5)
```

### Visual Representation
```
     ▲ y+
     │
  ┌──┼──┐   Rectangle is positioned at the RIGHT
  │  │  │   column of the braille cell, NOT centered
  │  │  │   on the cell itself
  │  │  │
  └──┼──┘
     └───► x+
```

### Position on Cards (Flat Plates)

| Plate Type | Column Position | Cell X Calculation |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Positive/Embossing | First column (column 0) | `left_margin + braille_x_adjust` |
| Counter/Negative | First column (column 0) | Same as positive |

### Position on Cylinders

| Plate Type | Column Position | Angular Position | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Positive/Embossing | Column 1 (second) | `apply_seam(start_angle + cell_spacing_angle)` | Only when first char is non-alphanumeric |
| Counter/Negative | Column 1 (second) | `apply_seam_mirrored(start_angle + cell_spacing_angle)` | **ALWAYS rectangle, never character** |

### Counter Plate Always Uses Rectangle (CRITICAL)

On counter plate cylinders, column 1 **always** uses a rectangle placeholder, never a character indicator. This matches the Python backend behavior:

```javascript
// In geometry_spec.py for counter plate cylinders
// Counter plates ALWAYS use rectangle placeholders, not character indicators
marker_spec = _create_cylinder_marker_spec(
    char_col_angle,
    y_local,
    radius,
    settings,
    'rect',  // Always rectangle for counter plate (not character)
    ...
)
```

## 3. Character Marker Indicator

### Purpose
Shows the first alphanumeric character of each row as a tactile indicator, allowing users to identify which row they are on.

### Geometry Specification

```
Shape: Extruded font character (A-Z, 0-9)

Dimensions (fit within braille cell boundary):
- Character Width: 1 × dot_spacing (horizontal/tangential direction)
  (= 2.5mm for default dot_spacing of 2.5mm)
- Character Height: 2 × dot_spacing (vertical/cylinder axis direction)
  (= 5.0mm for default dot_spacing of 2.5mm)
- Recess Depth: 0.5mm (matches rectangle marker depth)

Viewing Orientation (from outer cylinder surface, cylinder axis vertical):
- Width = left-right direction = dot_spacing
- Height = top-bottom direction = 2 × dot_spacing

Center Position (given cell center at x, y):
- Character centered at: (x + dot_spacing/2, y)
- Same position as rectangle marker

Font:
- Primary: "Arial Rounded MT Bold" (tactile-friendly)
- Fallback: "monospace, bold"
- Scaling: Fit character within cell boundary
```

### Rendering Methods

1. **Python Backend**: Uses matplotlib TextPath
2. **Standard CSG Worker**: Uses Three.js TextGeometry with loaded font
3. **Manifold CSG Worker**: Uses 8x8 bitmap font converted to box primitives

### Fallback Behavior

If character rendering fails (no font, non-alphanumeric character, rendering error):
- Falls back to **rectangle marker** with 0.5mm depth

### Position on Cards (Flat Plates)

| Plate Type | Column Position | Condition |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Positive/Embossing | First column (column 0) | Only when `original_lines[row][0].isalnum()` |
| Counter/Negative | First column (column 0) | Same condition |

### Position on Cylinders

| Plate Type | Column Position | Angular Position | Condition |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Positive/Embossing | Column 1 (second) | `apply_seam(start_angle + cell_spacing_angle)` | Only when first char is alphanumeric |
| Counter/Negative | **N/A** | **N/A** | **Counter plates use rectangle, NOT character** |

## 3.1 Manifold WASM Character Generation (Detailed Specification)

This section provides detailed technical specifications for the Manifold WASM character generation process, enabling future iterations to replicate or modify this architecture correctly.

### Overview

The Manifold WASM process cannot use font rendering libraries (matplotlib, Three.js TextGeometry) because it runs in a Web Worker with only the Manifold 3D library available. Instead, characters are generated using an **8x8 bitmap font converted to box primitives**.

### Bitmap Font Format

```javascript
// Font data structure: FONT8X8_BASIC object
// Each character maps to an array of 8 bytes (one per row)
// Each byte represents one row of pixels (8 bits = 8 columns)
// Bit 0 (LSB) = leftmost pixel, Bit 7 (MSB) = rightmost pixel

'T': [
    0x7E,  // Row 0: .██████. (top bar)
    0x18,  // Row 1: ...██... (stem)
    0x18,  // Row 2: ...██...
    0x18,  // Row 3: ...██...
    0x18,  // Row 4: ...██...
    0x18,  // Row 5: ...██...
    0x18,  // Row 6: ...██...
    0x00   // Row 7: ........ (empty)
]
```

### Supported Characters

- **Letters**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- **Numbers**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Unsupported characters**: Fall back to rectangle marker

### Font Style

- **Type**: Clean sans-serif geometric font
- **Grid**: 8 rows × 7 effective columns (column 8 typically empty)
- **Stroke Width**: 2 pixels typical
- **Design Principle**: No serifs, no decorative flourishes, uniform stroke widths

### Pixel-to-Box Conversion Algorithm

```
Input: Character, target width, target height, depth
Output: Manifold object (union of box primitives)

1. Look up character in FONT8X8_BASIC dictionary
2. Calculate pixel dimensions:
   - pixelWidth = targetWidth / 7 (7 effective columns)
   - pixelHeight = targetHeight / 8 (8 rows)

3. For each row (0-7) and column (0-6):
   - Check if bit is set: (rowData >> col) & 1
   - If set, create a Manifold box at calculated position

4. CRITICAL - Horizontal Mirroring:
   - posX = +halfWidth - (col + 0.5) × pixelWidth
   - This mirrors the letter so it appears correct when viewed
     from OUTSIDE the cylinder surface
   - Without mirroring, letters appear reversed (like reading
     through glass from behind)

5. Vertical positioning (no mirroring needed):
   - posZ = +halfHeight - (row + 0.5) × pixelHeight
   - Row 0 at top (+Z), Row 7 at bottom (-Z)

6. Union all pixel boxes into single Manifold object
```

### Coordinate System (Manifold Z-up)

```
Letter is created in XZ plane:
- X axis: Width (tangential direction on cylinder)
- Y axis: Depth (radial direction - points outward after rotation)
- Z axis: Height (along cylinder axis)

Origin: Center of character bounding box

After creation:
1. Rotate around Z: (theta - 90°) to align Y with radial direction
2. Translate to cylinder surface position
```

### Cylinder Surface Placement

```javascript
// Theta adjustment (CRITICAL for coordinate system compatibility)
const adjustedTheta = -theta;  // Negate to match Three.js convention

// Rotation to point depth radially outward
const thetaDeg = adjustedTheta * 180 / Math.PI;
letterShape.rotate(0, 0, thetaDeg - 90);

// Radial position (recess into surface)
const radialOffset = cylRadius - depth / 2;

// Final position
posX = radialOffset × cos(adjustedTheta)
posY = radialOffset × sin(adjustedTheta)
posZ = y_local  // Height along cylinder axis
```

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Theta Negation**: The theta angle must be negated (`-theta`) to match Three.js coordinate conventions. Without this, characters appear at wrong angular positions.

2. **Horizontal Mirroring**: Letters must be mirrored horizontally during pixel placement because they are viewed from outside the cylinder. The mirroring formula is:
   ```
   posX = +halfWidth - (col + 0.5) × pixelWidth  // Mirrored
   ```
   Not:
   ```
   posX = -halfWidth + (col + 0.5) × pixelWidth  // Non-mirrored (WRONG)
   ```

3. **Depth Direction**: The Y axis becomes the radial (depth) direction after rotation. Positive Y points outward from cylinder center.

4. **Recess Positioning**: For recessed markers, the radial offset is `cylRadius - depth/2` to center the marker geometry at the correct depth below the surface.

### Dimension Calculations

```javascript
// Input from geometry_spec.py
size = dot_spacing × 1.5  // Passed in spec

// Manifold worker calculations
dotSpacing = size / 1.5   // Recover original dot_spacing
charWidth = dotSpacing    // = dot_spacing (fits cell width)
charHeight = 2 × dotSpacing  // = 2 × dot_spacing (fits cell height)
depth = 0.5               // Default recess depth in mm
```

### Error Handling and Fallback

1. If character not in `FONT8X8_BASIC`: Return `null`, caller creates rectangle marker
2. If Manifold operations fail: Catch exception, return rectangle marker with 0.5mm depth
3. If parameters invalid (NaN theta, zero radius): Return `null` immediately

### Testing Verification

To verify correct character rendering:
1. **Symmetrical letters** (A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y, 0, 1, 8): Should appear identical regardless of mirroring
2. **Asymmetrical letters** (B, C, D, E, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, Z, 2-7, 9): Verify correct orientation
3. **Letter "B"**: Vertical bar should be on LEFT side when viewing from outside cylinder
4. **Letter "C"**: Opening should face RIGHT when viewing from outside cylinder

---

## 4. Tactile Seam Indicator (Cylinders Only)

### Purpose

Selected by `indicator_mode = "tactile"`. Replaces the marker columns with one indicator per braille row placed in the seam gap: **raised** on the embossing plate, **recessed** on the counter plate. A blind user can find the alignment point and tell which end is up by touch, and the freed marker cells become text capacity.

Ported from `OpenSCAD/Braille_Cylinder_STL_Generator.scad` (`tactile_raised`, `tactile_recess_cut`). The two implementations share the same geometry; the web version's dimension defaults are pinned by `tests/test_smoke.py::test_tactile_settings_defaults` and duplicated in both `THICKNESS_PRESETS` entries in `public/index.html`.

### Why It Works

Two properties make the raised/recessed pair nest:

- **Position.** The braille grid is centred on angle 0, so the midpoint of the gap between the last and first cell — measured the long way round through the seam — is always exactly **180°**. 180° is also the fixed point of the counter plate's angle-negating mirror (`apply_seam_mirrored`), so the arrow and its recess line up radially by construction, at any rotation of the paired cylinders, with no extra bookkeeping.
- **Shape.** An isosceles triangle **symmetric circumferentially**, apex toward the cylinder **top**. Circumferential symmetry means the mirrored recess has the same outline as the arrow, so the two nest instead of colliding. Axial asymmetry means the point is felt as "up" on both plates, while raised-versus-recessed identifies which cylinder is in hand.

The raise (0.5 mm) is deliberately **less than the braille dot height** (1.0 mm at defaults) so the dots, never the indicator, carry the rolling pressure.

### Parameters

Runtime fields, flat in the settings payload; schema home is `indicators.*` in `settings.schema.json`. Names match the OpenSCAD parameters.

| Field | Default | Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| `tactile_indicator_width` | 4.0 mm | 2–10 | Width measured around the cylinder |
| `tactile_indicator_length` | 10.0 mm | 2–15 | Length along the cylinder axis — long enough for a fingertip to read the direction of the point in one pass |
| `tactile_indicator_raise` | 0.5 mm | 0–2 | How far the emboss arrow stands proud of the surface |
| `tactile_recess_clearance` | 0.2 mm | 0–1 | Outline margin added around the counter recess |
| `tactile_recess_extra_depth` | 0.2 mm | 0–1 | Counter recess depth added on top of the raise (0 = exact same-depth nesting) |

These five values are also written into **both** Card Thickness presets (`THICKNESS_PRESETS` in `public/index.html`), identically: the arrow is sized by the finger that reads it, not by the card stock thickness. Changing a default therefore means changing four places — `settings.schema.json`, `app/models.py`, the HTML input defaults, and both preset entries.

### UI Location

The five dials live in their own **Tactile Indicator Dimensions** submenu of Expert Mode (fifth, after Surface Dimensions). The whole submenu is hidden unless **Row Indicator Style** is set to *Tactile seam arrow*, since the dials do nothing in visual mode.

Derived constants (`app/geometry_spec.py`, mirroring the `.scad`):

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `TACTILE_MIN_GAP_MARGIN` | 5.0 mm | Clear zone required either side of the indicator (2 mm dot zone per neighbouring cell + 1 mm margin) |
| `TACTILE_PRISM_SPAN` | 6.0 mm | Radial thickness of the working prism the outline is extruded into |
| `TACTILE_BASE_EMBED` | 0.2 mm | How far the raised arrow's base sinks below the surface, so the union is a solid overlap not a coplanar touch |
| `TACTILE_RECESS_OVERCUT` | 1.0 mm | How far the recess cutter projects past the surface, so the opening leaves no coplanar faces |
| `TACTILE_SEAM_THETA` | π | Seam-gap centre |

### Geometry Specification

`_create_tactile_indicator_spec()` emits one marker per row into `spec['markers']`:

```python
{
    'type': 'cylinder_tactile_arrow',
    'x': radius * cos(pi), 'y': y_local, 'z': radius * sin(pi),
    'theta': pi,                # seam-gap centre; its own negation
    'radius': radius,
    'width': tactile_indicator_width,
    'length': tactile_indicator_length,
    'outline_delta': ...,       # in-plane growth (recess only)
    'inner_radius': ...,        # shell band, inner
    'outer_radius': ...,        # shell band, outer
    'prism_span': 6.0,
    'is_recess': bool,          # False = union into emboss, True = subtract from counter
}
```

Band radii, with `R` = cylinder radius:

| Plate | `inner_radius` | `outer_radius` | `outline_delta` |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Emboss (`is_recess: false`) | `R − TACTILE_BASE_EMBED` | `R + raise` | 0 |
| Counter (`is_recess: true`) | `R − raise − extra_depth` | `R + TACTILE_RECESS_OVERCUT` | `clearance` |

Row pitch is identical to the visual markers: `first_row_center_y − row * line_spacing + braille_y_adjust`, converted to `y_local`.

### CSG Construction (`createCylinderTactileArrowManifold`)

1. Build the outline in the local frame — **+X circumferential, +Y toward the cylinder top** — wound counter-clockwise: `[(-w/2, -l/2), (w/2, -l/2), (0, l/2)]`.
2. Grow it by `outline_delta` using `offsetPolygonMiter()`, an analytic mitered offset equivalent to OpenSCAD's `offset(delta = ...)`. Done analytically rather than via `CrossSection.offset()` because the arrow's apex (≈44° at defaults) is sharper than Manifold's default miter limit of 2, which would silently square it off.
3. Extrude by `prism_span` and centre the radial extent on the origin.
4. `rotate(90, 0, 0)`: local +Y (axial) → world +Z, local +Z (extrusion, i.e. radial) → world −Y. Then `rotate(0, 0, θ + 90)` aims that radial direction at θ.
5. Translate to `(R cos θ, R sin θ, y)` so the prism straddles the surface, reaching `prism_span/2` both outward and inward.
6. **Intersect with a shell band** — an annulus between `inner_radius` and `outer_radius`, tessellated at **64 segments to match the shell**. This is what makes the raise and the recess depth radially uniform: a flat 4 mm prism on a 15.4 mm radius would otherwise lose ~0.13 mm at its edges to the chord sagitta, which is large next to a 0.2 mm nesting margin. Sharing the segment count means band and shell tessellate identically, so their radial difference is constant across the whole arrow.

`processGeometrySpec()` splits markers by `is_recess`: `is_recess === false` markers are unioned into the base (before the subtractive pass, so a recess can never be filled back in), everything else is subtracted. Visual markers all carry `is_recess: true`, and flat-card markers omit the field, so both keep their existing subtract-only behavior.

### Seam Gap Check

```
seam_gap_mm = π × diameter − (total_grid_columns − 1) × cell_spacing
required    = tactile_indicator_width + TACTILE_MIN_GAP_MARGIN
```

When `seam_gap_mm < required` the layout is **warned about, not rejected** — matching the OpenSCAD version, which renders a 3D "TACTILE GAP TOO SMALL" label:

- **Backend:** the message is appended to `spec['warnings']` (a list, always present, empty in visual mode) and logged.
- **Frontend:** `checkPhysicalFit()` shows it live in `#tactile-gap-warning` (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`), recomputed whenever the diameter, cell spacing, cell count, indicator width, or mode changes. Generation is not blocked.

At defaults (30.75 mm diameter, 6.5 mm cell spacing, 4 mm indicator) the gap needs ≥ 9 mm: 13 cells leave 18.6 mm and 14 cells leave 12.1 mm, both passing; 15 cells leave 5.6 mm and warn. The UI recommends 14, the widest tactile layout that still clears the arrow.

### Column Layout

**Both plates, tactile mode:**
```
Columns 0 to N-1:   Braille content (no shift; reserved = 0)
Seam gap at 180°:   One tactile indicator per row

Where N = grid_columns
Available braille columns = N
```

### Coverage

- `tests/test_smoke.py` — marker columns dropped on both plates, arrow raised on positive and recessed on negative with the correct band radii, θ = π on both plates at identical row heights, gap warning, visual mode unaffected, full-width row accepted in tactile but rejected in visual, unknown `indicator_mode` rejected, defaults matching OpenSCAD, schema/model default agreement.
- `tests/e2e/tactileIndicator.spec.ts` — payload column arithmetic and tactile parameters, the 14-cell tactile recommendation, neither recommended layout tripping the seam-gap warning, a 14-cell row accepted in tactile and blocked in visual, live gap warning, Expert Mode dimension visibility.

## Differences Between Embossing Plate and Universal Counter Plate

### CRITICAL: Card Counter Plates Use ONLY Rectangles (Never Character Indicators)

There is an intentional difference between the embossing plate and universal counter plate:

| Aspect | Embossing Plate (Positive) | Universal Counter Plate (Negative) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Dots** | Only active braille dots (raised) | ALL 6 dots per cell (recessed) |
| **Column 0 Indicator** | Character OR Rectangle (based on first char) | **ALWAYS Rectangle** |
| **Triangle at Last Column** | Yes (recessed) | Yes (recessed) |
| **Recess Depth** | 0.5-0.6mm per indicator type | Unified depth (based on recess_shape) |

### Rationale for Rectangle-Only on Counter Plates

The universal counter plate uses rectangles instead of character indicators because:

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Counter plates are designed to work with ANY embossing plate, regardless of text content
2. **Manufacturing Simplicity**: Consistent rectangle shape is easier to manufacture
3. **Alignment Focus**: The rectangle serves as an alignment guide, not content identification

### Implementation (Consistent Across All Methods)

**Python Backend** (`backend.py` line 1166):
```python
# In create_universal_counter_plate_2d()
# Rectangle at first column (line end marker)
rect = create_line_marker_polygon(x_pos_first, y_pos, params)
indicator_holes.append(rect)
```

**CSG Workers** (`geometry_spec.py` for negative card plates):
```python
# Universal counter plates ALWAYS use rectangle markers at column 0
# (never character indicators) - matches backend.py behavior
spec['markers'].append({'type': 'rect', ...})
```

## Column Layout Summary

### Cards (Flat Plates) with Indicators Enabled

**Embossing Plate (Positive):**
```
Column 0:           Character/Rectangle indicator (based on first char of row)
Columns 1 to N-2:   Braille content (shifted by 1)
Column N-1:         Triangle marker (at last cell)

Where N = grid_columns (default 15: 13 text + 2 marker columns)
Available braille columns = N - 2 = 13
```

**Universal Counter Plate (Negative):**
```
Column 0:           Rectangle ONLY (never character)
Columns 1 to N-2:   ALL 6 dot recesses per cell (shifted by 1)
Column N-1:         Triangle marker (at last cell)

Where N = grid_columns (default 15: 13 text + 2 marker columns)
```

### Cylinders with Indicators Enabled

**Positive/Embossing Plate:**
```
Column 0:           Triangle marker
Column 1:           Character/Rectangle indicator (based on first char)
Columns 2 to N-1:   Braille content (shifted by 2)

Where N = grid_columns
Available braille columns = N - 2
```

**Counter/Negative Plate (CONSISTENT across all methods):**
```
Column 0:           Triangle marker (rotate_180 = true)
Column 1:           Rectangle placeholder (ALWAYS rectangle, not character)
Columns 2 to N-1:   ALL 6 dot recesses per cell

Where N = grid_columns
```

## Recess Depth Differences

### Embossing Plate (Positive) Indicator Depths

All indicators on embossing plates are recesses (subtracted from the raised surface):

| Indicator Type | Depth | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Triangle Marker | 0.6mm | Standard depth |
| Rectangle Marker | 0.5mm | Standard fallback depth |
| Character Marker | 0.5mm | Matches rectangle marker depth |

### Universal Counter Plate (Negative) Depths

The counter plate uses a **unified recess depth** for ALL features (dots and indicators):

```python
# From backend.py create_universal_counter_plate_2d()
# Recess depth is determined by the recess_shape setting:

if recess_shape == 2:  # Cone
    recess_depth = cone_counter_dot_height  # Default 0.8mm
elif recess_shape == 1:  # Bowl
    recess_depth = counter_dot_depth  # Default 0.6mm
else:  # Hemisphere (recess_shape == 0)
    recess_depth = hemi_counter_dot_base_diameter / 2  # Half the diameter
```

| Recess Shape | Depth Source | Typical Depth |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Cone (2) | `cone_counter_dot_height` | 0.8mm |
| Bowl (1) | `counter_dot_depth` | 0.6mm |
| Hemisphere (0) | `hemi_counter_dot_base_diameter / 2` | ~0.8mm |

**Key Difference**: On counter plates, the triangle and rectangle indicators use the SAME depth as the dot recesses, not their individual depths (0.6mm, 0.5mm).

## Cylinder Angular Calculations

### Key Formulas

```python
# From geometry_spec.py

# Grid dimensions
grid_width = (grid_columns - 1) * cell_spacing  # Physical width in mm
grid_angle = grid_width / radius                 # Angular span in radians
start_angle = -grid_angle / 2                    # Center the content

# Per-cell calculations
cell_spacing_angle = cell_spacing / radius       # Angle between cells
dot_spacing_angle = dot_spacing / radius         # Angle between dots in cell

# Angular position for column N
column_angle = start_angle + (N * cell_spacing_angle)
```

### Seam Offset (Polygon Cutout Only)

The `seam_offset_deg` parameter rotates **ONLY the polygon cutout**, not the braille content:

```python
# From geometry_spec.py

seam_offset_rad = math.radians(seam_offset)
if plate_type == 'negative':
    # Counter plate: rotate polygon CLOCKWISE
    cutout_align_theta = seam_offset_rad
else:
    # Embossing plate: rotate polygon COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
    cutout_align_theta = -seam_offset_rad
```

### Angular Direction Functions

```python
def apply_seam(angle: float) -> float:
    """For positive/embossing plate - content flows COUNTER-CLOCKWISE."""
    return -angle

def apply_seam_mirrored(angle: float) -> float:
    """For counter plate - content flows CLOCKWISE (mirrored)."""
    return +angle
```

## Radial Positioning (Cylinder Dots and Markers)

### Key Principle

All features (dots, markers) must be positioned at the correct radial distance and oriented to point radially outward.

### Radial Offset Calculation

```javascript
// For recesses (counter plates, all markers)
if (is_recess) {
    if (shape === 'cone') {
        radialOffset = cylRadius - dotHeight / 2;
    } else {
        // Spherical shapes (hemisphere, bowl)
        radialOffset = cylRadius;  // Center at surface
    }
} else {
    // For protrusions (embossing dots)
    radialOffset = cylRadius + dotHeight / 2 + epsilon;
}

// Final 3D position
const posX = radialOffset * Math.cos(theta);
const posZ = radialOffset * Math.sin(theta);  // Z for Three.js, Y for Manifold
const posY = y_local;  // Height along cylinder axis
```

### Orientation Transformations

**For Three.js (Y-up, csg-worker.js):**
```javascript
// Rotate cone frustum to point radially outward
geometry.rotateZ(-Math.PI / 2);  // Align with +X
geometry.rotateY(-theta);         // Point toward radial direction

// For markers (extrusions along depth)
geometry.rotateY(Math.PI / 2 - theta);  // Depth points radially
```

**For Manifold (Z-up, csg-worker-manifold.js):**
```javascript
// Rotate frustum to point radially
dot.rotate(0, 90, 0);            // Z -> X (radial at theta=0)
rotatedDot.rotate(0, 0, thetaDeg);  // Rotate to correct angle

// For markers
marker.rotate(0, 0, thetaDeg - 90);  // Y (depth) points radially
```

## Common Orientation Bugs and Solutions

### Bug 1: Triangle Pointing Wrong Direction on Counter Plates

**Symptom**: Triangle apex points right instead of left on counter plate
**Cause**: Missing `rotate_180` flag
**Solution**: Ensure counter plate triangles have `rotate_180: true`

### Bug 2: Markers Not Visible on Cylinder

**Symptom**: Markers appear inside cylinder or float outside
**Cause**: Incorrect radial offset calculation
**Solution**: Verify `radialOffset = cylRadius - depth/2` for recesses

### Bug 3: Dots/Markers at Wrong Angle

**Symptom**: Features appear rotated or at wrong position around cylinder
**Cause**: Sign error in `apply_seam` or `apply_seam_mirrored`
**Solution**:
- Positive plate: `theta = -raw_angle` (counter-clockwise)
- Counter plate: `theta = +raw_angle` (clockwise)

### Bug 4: Cylinder Upside Down in STL

**Symptom**: Cylinder appears inverted when imported to slicer
**Cause**: Missing final rotation in Three.js CSG worker
**Solution**: Apply `geometry.rotateX(Math.PI / 2)` after CSG operations

### Bug 5: Character Indicators Missing on Cylinders

**Symptom**: No character shapes, only rectangles
**Cause**: Font loading failed in CSG worker
**Solution**: Check console for font loading errors, falls back to rectangle

### Bug 6: Counter Plate Recess Depths Don't Match Individual Marker Depths

**Symptom**: Counter plate indicator recesses are shallower/deeper than expected
**Cause**: Counter plate uses unified `recess_depth` for ALL features, not individual marker depths
**Note**: This is intentional behavior - counter plates use consistent depth based on `recess_shape` setting
**No fix needed**: This is by design for manufacturing consistency

## Validation Checklist

When implementing or modifying indicator code, verify:

### Triangle Marker
- [ ] Apex points RIGHT on positive plates
- [ ] Apex points LEFT on counter plates (rotate_180 for cylinders)
- [ ] Depth is 0.6mm on embossing plates
- [ ] Depth matches recess_shape setting on counter plates
- [ ] Positioned at correct column (last for cards, first for cylinders)

### Rectangle Marker
- [ ] Width = dot_spacing, Height = 2 × dot_spacing
- [ ] Depth is 0.5mm on embossing plates
- [ ] Depth matches recess_shape setting on counter plates
- [ ] Centered at (x + dot_spacing/2, y)
- [ ] Counter plate cylinders ALWAYS use rectangle at column 1
- [ ] Universal counter plates for CARDS use rectangle ONLY at column 0

### Character Marker
- [ ] Only created when first character is alphanumeric
- [ ] Depth is 0.5mm on embossing plates (matches rectangle)
- [ ] Width = dot_spacing, Height = 2 × dot_spacing (fits within cell)
- [ ] Falls back to rectangle on failure
- [ ] NOT used on counter plate cylinders
- [ ] NOT used on universal counter plates for CARDS
- [ ] **Manifold WASM**: Letters horizontally mirrored for correct outside-cylinder viewing
- [ ] **Manifold WASM**: Asymmetric letters (B, C, D, etc.) appear correctly oriented

### All Markers
- [ ] Always SUBTRACTED (recessed), never added
- [ ] Correct coordinate system transformations applied
- [ ] Final STL is Z-up orientation

### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Python backend output matches CSG worker output for same inputs
- [ ] Embossing and counter plates align when pressed together
- [ ] All features are within the plate boundaries
- [ ] Counter plates have rectangle indicators only (never characters)

## Test Cases

### Flat Card Tests

1. **All rows with alphanumeric first character**
   - Expected: Character indicators at column 0, triangles at column N-1

2. **Mixed first characters (some symbols)**
   - Expected: Characters for alphanumeric, rectangles for symbols/empty

3. **Empty rows**
   - Expected: Rectangle at column 0, triangle at column N-1

### Cylinder Tests

1. **Positive plate with text**
   - Expected: Triangles at column 0, characters at column 1, braille at 2+

2. **Counter plate**
   - Expected: Rotated triangles at column 0, rectangles at column 1, recesses at 2+

3. **Verify alignment by visual inspection**
   - Place generated positive and negative STLs together
   - Triangle apexes should point toward each other
   - All features should align when plates are pressed together

### Tactile Mode Tests

1. **Emboss plate, `indicator_mode = tactile`**
   - Expected: no triangles or squares; one raised arrow per row at 180°, apex toward the cylinder top; braille starting at column 0
   - Measured on the exported STL: maximum radius at the seam is `R + 0.5`; overall maximum radius is `R + 1.0` (the dots, which must stay taller than the arrow)

2. **Counter plate, `indicator_mode = tactile`**
   - Expected: no triangles or squares; one arrow recess per row at 180°, same row heights as the emboss arrows; recesses for every cell in every column
   - Measured on the exported STL: maximum radius equals `R` exactly — nothing protrudes

3. **Verify nesting by visual inspection**
   - Both plates' arrows sit at the same angular position and row heights, so the raised arrow enters the recess
   - The arrow must sit lower than the braille dots

| 2026-07-31 | 3.2 | Per-row text capacity at defaults changed to 13 cells in visual mode (either toggle state, `grid_columns` default 15) and 14 in tactile mode, so a 13-cell UEB phone number fits one row |
| 2026-08-16 | 3.3 | Double-sided (interpoint) beta: `indicator_mode` is LOCKED to `tactile` whenever `double_sided_enabled` is on — the UI disables the visual radio and `validate_double_sided_settings()` rejects non-tactile double-sided requests with HTTP 400. Cylinder A keeps the raised arrows, Cylinder B the recesses, and the arrow's 180° position is the fixed point of the A/B pairing mirror. See INTERPOINT_DOUBLE_SIDED_SPECIFICATIONS.md |
