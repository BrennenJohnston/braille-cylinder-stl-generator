# Embossing Plate Recessed Shapes Fix

> **Historical record, written 2025-11-29.** It describes the project at that time. For how it works now, see [RECESS_INDICATOR_SPECIFICATIONS.md](../specifications/RECESS_INDICATOR_SPECIFICATIONS.md).

## Problem Statement
The embossing plate recessed shapes (character indicators and triangle markers) were not working, even though the counter plate and indicator symbols on that plate had been fixed previously.

## Root Cause
The embossing plate generation code had two issues:

1. **Missing 2D Character Polygon Function**: While there were 2D polygon functions for line markers (`create_line_marker_polygon`) and triangle markers (`create_triangle_marker_polygon`), there was no corresponding function for character shapes. The serverless-friendly 2D approach was only creating line and triangle recesses, not character recesses.

2. **Serverless-Only Restriction**: The 2D approach for creating recesses was restricted to serverless environments only (via `_is_serverless_env()` check). In local environments, the code would fall back to simply combining meshes without creating any recesses.

## Solution

### 1. Added `create_character_shape_polygon` Function
Created a new helper function to generate 2D character polygons for use in the serverless-friendly recess creation approach:

```python
def create_character_shape_polygon(character, x, y, settings: CardSettings):
    """
    Create a 2D character polygon for the beginning-of-row indicator.
    This is used for creating recesses in embossing plates using 2D operations.
    """
```

This function:
- Uses the existing `_build_character_polygon` helper to create character shapes
- Falls back to rectangular markers for non-alphanumeric characters
- Maintains consistency with the 3D version (`create_character_shape_3d`)

### 2. Updated Serverless Approach to Include Character Indicators
Modified the 2D recess creation logic (lines 904-942 in `backend.py`) to:
- Check if each row should have a character indicator or rectangle marker
- Use `create_character_shape_polygon` when appropriate
- Match the logic used in the 3D mesh creation (lines 739-759)

### 3. Removed Serverless-Only Restriction
Changed line 892 from:
```python
if getattr(settings, 'indicator_shapes', 1) and marker_meshes and _is_serverless_env():
```

To:
```python
if getattr(settings, 'indicator_shapes', 1) and marker_meshes:
```

This makes the 2D approach work in **all environments** (local, serverless, production), which is more reliable since it doesn't depend on external 3D boolean engines.

### 4. Increased Recess Depth
Updated the recess depth from 0.6mm to 1.0mm to accommodate character indicators (which use 1.0mm depth as specified in the 3D version).

## Files Modified
- `backend.py`: Added `create_character_shape_polygon` function and updated recess creation logic

## Testing
All smoke tests pass:
- ✅ Card positive plate generation
- ✅ Card counter plate generation
- ✅ Cylinder positive plate generation
- ✅ Cylinder counter plate generation
- ✅ Validation tests

Verification tests confirm:
- ✅ Recesses are created in both serverless and local environments
- ✅ All generated meshes are watertight
- ✅ Character indicators produce different geometry than rectangle markers
- ✅ Mixed indicators (alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric) work correctly

## Expected Changes
The golden test fixtures will need to be regenerated because:
- Face counts have increased (e.g., from 2646 to ~4428 for cards)
- This is expected and correct - the additional faces come from the recessed shapes that are now being properly created

## Benefits
1. **Embossing plates now have proper recessed shapes** for row indicators and markers
2. **Works in all environments** (not just serverless)
3. **More reliable** - uses 2D Shapely operations instead of 3D boolean engines
4. **Consistent behavior** between counter plates and embossing plates
5. **Character indicators are properly supported** on embossing plates

## Related Previous Fixes
This fix builds upon the earlier fix that made counter plate recessed shapes work. The same 2D approach is now applied to embossing plates, ensuring consistency across both plate types.
