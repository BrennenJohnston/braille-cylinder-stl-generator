# Security Audit Report
**Braille Business Card & Cylinder STL Generator**

> **Historical record, written 2025-12-07 and revised until 2026-02-16.** It describes the project at that time. For how it works now, see [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) and the headers `set_security_headers` adds in `backend.py`.

**Audit Date:** December 7, 2025
**Auditor:** Full Security Review
**Project Version:** Pre-release stable milestone

---

## ⚠️ Architecture Update Notice (2026-01-05)

This audit was performed against the **pre-2026 architecture** that included **Redis/Blob caching** and **server-side STL generation**.

As of **2026-01-05**, those systems were removed and the backend is now a **minimal Flask app** that primarily serves **`/geometry_spec`** for client-side generation. Some findings and dependency references below are therefore **historical** and may no longer apply.

For current configuration, see:
- `docs/security/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- `docs/development/CODEBASE_AUDIT_AND_RENOVATION_PLAN.md`

## ✅ Security Hardening Update (2026-01-28)

The following security improvements were implemented as part of the compatibility hardening plan:

### 1. Worker Message Validation (Defense against malformed message attacks)

**Files Modified:**
- `static/workers/csg-worker.js`
- `static/workers/csg-worker-manifold.js`
- `static/liblouis-worker.js`

**Improvements:**
- Added message type allowlisting (rejects unknown message types)
- Added required field validation (requestId/id must be present)
- Added spec object structure validation for 'generate' type messages
- All invalid messages now return proper error responses

### 2. innerHTML XSS Prevention

**File Modified:** `public/index.html` (translation error display)

**Improvement:**
- Replaced `innerHTML` with safe DOM building using `textContent` and `createElement`
- User-provided error text (`err.text`) is now properly escaped
- Prevents potential script injection in error messages

### 3. Backend Path Traversal Hardening

**File Modified:** `backend.py` (`serve_static()` function)

**Improvements:**
- Added explicit validation rejecting `..` sequences
- Added validation rejecting absolute paths
- Added null byte injection protection
- Added path normalization with directory escape detection
- All blocked attempts are logged for monitoring

### 4. CSP Enhancement

**File Modified:** `backend.py` (security headers)

**Improvement:**
- Added `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` directive alongside `'unsafe-eval'`
- Modern browsers (Chrome 97+, Firefox 102+) will use the more restrictive `wasm-unsafe-eval`
- Maintains backward compatibility for older browsers

### 5. Legacy File Deprecation

**File Modified:** `templates/index.html`

**Improvement:**
- Added prominent deprecation notice documenting missing security/accessibility features
- Points developers to `public/index.html` as the authoritative source

---

## Detailed Findings

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Release

#### 1. CORS Configuration Exposes Placeholder Domains (CRITICAL)
**File:** `backend.py:82-91`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**CWE:** CWE-942 (Overly Permissive Cross-origin Resource Sharing Policy)

**Issue:**
The CORS configuration contains placeholder domains that will allow malicious sites matching these patterns to make authenticated requests to your API.

**Impact:**
- Malicious sites could potentially make requests on behalf of users
- Cross-origin attacks possible if someone registers these domains
- Session hijacking risk if credentials are involved

**Remediation:**
Replace placeholder domains with actual production domains using environment variables.

**Verification:** Test CORS headers from unauthorized domains before deployment.

---

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY - Address Before Launch

#### 2. SECRET_KEY Uses Weak Default in Production (HIGH)
**File:** `backend.py:96`
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

**Issue:**
If the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is not set, the application falls back to a predictable default. This key is used for session signing and CSRF protection.

**Impact:**
- Session hijacking via forged session cookies
- CSRF token bypass
- Compromise of signed data integrity

**Remediation:**
Make SECRET_KEY mandatory in production with a RuntimeError if not set.

**Verification:** Confirm app fails to start without SECRET_KEY in production mode.

---

#### 3. XSS Risk in Dynamic HTML Generation (HIGH)
**File:** `public/index.html:2694, 3547, 4990`
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)

**Issue:**
Multiple instances of `.innerHTML` assignment with dynamic content where error messages are rendered as HTML.

**Impact:**
- Cross-site scripting attacks if error messages reflect user input
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Malicious script execution in user context

**Remediation:**
Use `.textContent` for plain text or DOMPurify for HTML formatting.

**Verification:**
- Test with malicious input: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- Verify error messages don't execute scripts

---

#### 4. Redis Connection Without TLS Validation (HIGH)
**File:** `app/cache.py:40`
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation)

**Issue:**
The Redis connection is created without explicit TLS/SSL configuration or certificate validation.

**Impact:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on Redis traffic
- Cache poisoning
- Session data interception
- Credential exposure if stored in cache

**Remediation:**
Enforce TLS (`rediss://`) for non-localhost connections in production with proper certificate validation.

**Verification:**
- Test with `rediss://` URL
- Verify connection fails with invalid certificates
- Monitor TLS handshake in production logs

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Address Soon

#### 5. Subprocess Execution Without Input Validation (MEDIUM)
**File:** `wsgi.py:18`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command)

**Issue:**
The use of `subprocess.run` in diagnostic functions should be restricted to development mode only.

**Impact:**
- Low immediate risk (hardcoded commands)
- Pattern could be copied unsafely elsewhere
- Information disclosure about system configuration

**Remediation:**
Limit diagnostic functions to development mode only.

---

#### 6. Request Size Limit May Be Insufficient (MEDIUM)
**File:** `backend.py:95`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)

**Issue:**
1MB may be too generous for the expected request payloads which are primarily JSON text.

**Impact:**
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Memory consumption
- Bandwidth abuse

**Remediation:**
Reduce to 100KB with per-endpoint limits.

---

#### 7. Rate Limiting May Be Too Permissive (MEDIUM)
**File:** `backend.py:101-117`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)

**Issue:**
- 10 requests/minute for STL generation is high for computationally expensive operations
- No daily or hourly limits to prevent sustained abuse
- IP-based limiting easily bypassed

**Impact:**
- Resource exhaustion through sustained requests
- CPU/memory exhaustion on serverless platform
- Cost inflation

**Remediation:**
Implement tiered rate limiting: per-minute, per-hour, per-day limits.

---

#### 8. Content Security Policy Allows 'unsafe-eval' (MEDIUM)
**File:** `backend.py:298`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames)

**Issue:**
The CSP includes `'unsafe-eval'` as a fallback for older browsers.

**Impact:**
- Allows `eval()` and `Function()` constructor in all browsers
- XSS attacks can execute arbitrary code via eval
- Reduces effectiveness of CSP as a security layer

**Remediation:**
Remove `'unsafe-eval'` and document minimum browser requirements.

---

#### 9. Missing Security Headers for Subresources (MEDIUM)
**File:** `backend.py:276-311`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)

**Issue:**
Missing headers: COEP, COOP, CORP

**Impact:**
- Reduced defense-in-depth
- Cross-origin attacks may be easier
- Spectre/Meltdown vulnerability mitigation incomplete

**Remediation:**
Add Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy headers.

---

#### 10. Blob Storage Token Exposure in Debug Endpoint (MEDIUM)
**File:** `backend.py:199-273`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)

**Issue:**
Debug endpoint accessible without authentication in production.

**Impact:**
- Information disclosure about deployment
- Potential for blob storage abuse
- Configuration fingerprinting

**Remediation:**
Restrict debug endpoints to development mode only.

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Enhancements

#### 11. Filename Sanitization Could Be Stronger (LOW)
**File:** `backend.py:1238-1262`
**Severity:** LOW
**CWE:** CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)

**Improvement:**
Create dedicated sanitize_filename() function with null byte removal and directory traversal prevention.

---

#### 12. Missing HTTP Security Headers on Static Files (LOW)
**File:** `backend.py:716-764`
**Severity:** LOW

**Improvement:**
Add X-Content-Type-Options and proper cache headers to static files.

---

#### 13. Redis Password May Be Logged (LOW)
**File:** `app/cache.py:36-43`
**Severity:** LOW
**CWE:** CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)

**Improvement:**
Redact password from Redis URL before logging.

---

#### 14. No Input Length Validation on original_lines (LOW)
**File:** `backend.py:943, 1349`
**Severity:** LOW
**CWE:** CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)

**Improvement:**
Add validate_original_lines() function with type and length checking.
