# Security Implementation Summary

> **Historical record, written 2025-12-06 and revised until 2026-02-16.** It describes the project at that time. For how it works now, see [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) and the headers `set_security_headers` adds in `backend.py`.

**Last updated:** January 2026

> **Note:** This document was originally written for the pre-2026 architecture that included Redis and Blob storage. Those systems were removed in v2.0.0. Items related to Redis TLS, rate limiting, and blob storage are historical.

> For current configuration, see [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md).

## Current security posture (v2.0.0)

The v2.0.0 architecture significantly reduced the attack surface by removing external services:

- **No Redis** — no cache poisoning, no credential exposure
- **No Blob storage** — no token management, no storage abuse
- **Minimal server** — Flask serves static files and one JSON endpoint
- **Client-side generation** — STL files are built in the browser, not on the server

### What's still in place

- Input validation and sanitization (100KB request limit)
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, COEP, COOP, CORP)
- Path traversal protection on the static file handler
- XSS prevention (textContent instead of innerHTML for user-facing content)
- CSP with `wasm-unsafe-eval` for WebAssembly support
- Error handling that doesn't expose stack traces in production

### Environment variables

All optional in v2.0.0. See [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) for details.

## Original audit (December 2025)

A security audit found 14 issues (1 critical, 3 high, 6 medium, 4 low). All were fixed before the v1.3.0 release. Most of the fixes targeted infrastructure that was later removed entirely in v2.0.0.

See [SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) for the full findings and [SECURITY_FIXES_APPLIED.md](SECURITY_FIXES_APPLIED.md) for what was changed.

## Maintenance

- Run `pip-audit` and `npm audit` periodically to check for dependency vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies up to date via Dependabot PRs
- If you set a `SECRET_KEY`, rotate it occasionally (though the backend is stateless and doesn't use sessions)
